<hr><p>I am a sophomore at UGA and I am a <em> psychology </em> major. I was undecided my entire freshman year and I still don’t know what I want to do. I am excited to continue to take more classes and discover what I want to do. I have liked all of my psychology classes but I’m not sure how I feel about computer science. I think it is interesting and useful but I am not very good at it. </p>
<p>I played tennis and softball in high school. In college, I started to play on an intramural tennis and I still play for fun. I stopped playing softball my sophomore year of high school. I did cross country my senior year of high school but I don’t really like to run.</p>
<p>I am making this webpage for this class and I think it could be a very fun and useful skill for the future even though it is difficult. <p> </hr>
